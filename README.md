# FerretPortal
This is a personal project created for our household to keep track of our ferrets' stool, active time, and weights.
The website and it's accompanying Database is tailor made for our personal use, as there is no option to add/remove ferrets.

### The Database and website run off two different servers connected and only accessible through LAN
